# Monzo Spy

A tiny service that glues the Monzo API to the Nexmo SMS API.

# What does/will it do?

Register this service as a webhook receiver for Monzo updates.
When it receives transaction info, it will look up the current account balance, and then send you an SMS.

# Why?

Well, you might not have a data connection if you're abroad.
My particular use-case is to get an alert when my tween daughter spends money.

# How Do I Run It?

No idea. It doesn't really work yet.
